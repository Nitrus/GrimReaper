MAT Extraction Tool for Grim Fandango

<h3>About</h3>
This is a big, messy blob of code that enables the user to manipulate Grim Fandango *.MAT files. It was written hastily, I'm definitely not proud of it.<br />
For more information about the software or the modding community, please refer to: <br />

<i>This software uses the FreeImage open source image library. See http://freeimage.sourceforge.net for details.
FreeImage is used under the GNU GPL, version 3.</i>

<h3>Requirements</h3>
Microsoft .NET Frameworks 4.0 - http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17851<br />
The FreeImage Library for C# - http://freeimage.sourceforge.net/download.html <br /> The FreeImage wrapper is included within this project, so you'll only have to get the ./FreeImage/Dist/FreeImage.dll from the downloaded archive, and place it in the same folder as the executable.

<h3>TODO</h3>
<ul>
<li>Make all of <i>this</i> a decent project, properly classed and formatted, with descriptive variable names.</li>
<li>Get rid of non-generic, non-reusable code. (which the bigger part of this software currently is) </li>
<li>Add ability of reading .COS files, allowing for .MAT files to be automatically linked with their corresponding .CMP files. </li>
<li>Make a better icon.</li>
</ul>
