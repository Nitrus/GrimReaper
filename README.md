MAT Extraction Tool for Grim Fandango

<h3>About</h3>
This is a big, messy blob of code that enables the user to manipulate Grim Fandango *.MAT files. It was written hastily, I'm definitely not proud of it.

<h3>Requirements</h3>
Microsoft .NET Frameworks 4.0 - http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17851" <br />
The FreeImage Library for C# - http://freeimage.sourceforge.net/download.html <br /> The wrapper is included within this project, so you'll only have to get the ./FreeImage/Dist/FreeImage.dll from the downloaded archive, and place it in the same folder as the executable.
